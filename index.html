Dear …,
 
This letter has surfaced for the need of expressing my heartfelt apologies for not continuing my service with LTI with immediate effect.
 
Certain unfortunate events have cropped up on the personal front of mine and these have denied me to assume the job in L&T Infotech.
 
This is more of a grim loss to me than to the firm and I regret the occurrence of these unfortunate circumstances (Job Profile & Technology mismatch in L&T).
 
I thought prior leaving the establishment I felt to write a sincere apology letter as HR puts lots of efforts to hire people.

Please accept my apology if possible as I will be not continuing with L&T from today itself! 

I’m really sorry again for this whole matter.
